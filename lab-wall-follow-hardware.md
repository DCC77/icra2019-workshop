title: Wall Follow Lab (Hardware)
layout: post
---

It's time to use the actual racecar!
In this lab you will be taking the wall following code that you ran in
simulation and running it on the car. You will also be building a safety
controller to prevent your racecar from crashing into obstacles.

## Part 1: Review Hardware
The racecar platform is exciting and fast but it is not a toy.
The hardware we have on board
[is](https://www.amazon.com/NVIDIA-Jetson-TX2-Development-Kit/dp/B06XPFH939)
[extremely](https://www.spar3d.com/news/lidar/velodyne-cuts-vlp-16-lidar-price-4k/)
[expensive](https://www.robotshop.com/en/hokuyo-ust-10lx-scanning-laser-rangefinder.html?gclid=Cj0KCQiAq6_UBRCEARIsAHyrgUxYmgjfz734t-zWCqa2U4l7LAVsZ1_cp2CuvuD3WalcBQ9tCp2_WmMaAjbAEALw_wcB)
and it is your responsibility to keep it in good condition for future classes.
The racecar can survive a couple light bumps but if it goes flying into a wall
it can be destroyed. The whole frame can split in half, the lidar can get
scratched, the TX2 can get damaged, etc. Any one of these repairs can cost
hundreds if not thousands of dollars in addition to the dozens of hours repair
time.

If your car develops hardware issues for any reason, please tell an instrutor
immediately and we will do our best to repair it. Over the course of a full
semester, most teams will probably have some sort of hardware issue and it is
typically not a big deal.
That being said, do not exhibit obviously reckless behavior!

Before continuing, please review a full breakdown of the hardware
[here](./hardware).

## Part 2: Wall Following

Use ```scp``` or ```git clone``` to get one of your team members' wall following
code from the simulated lab onto the car.
Just like in the simulated lab the wall follower should live in the ```src``` folder of your
workspace, ```~/racecar_ws/src/[WALL_FOLLOWER_CODE]```.
```catkin_make``` in the root of your workspace to rebuild it and then
```source ~/racecar_ws/devel/setup.bash```.

Before running the ```wall_follower``` change the ```drive_topic``` param to
```/vesc/ackermann_cmd_mux/input/navigation```. See the
[muxes section below](https://github.com/mit-rss/wall_follower#muxes) for more
details. Get the car into a safe location and make sure ```teleop``` is running.
In another terminal launch

    roslaunch wall_follower wall_follower.launch
    
Hopefully this will work without any changes!
To activate the wall follower, hold down the right bumper on the joystick
If necessary, tune the parameters in the wall follower so that it works well in
real life. Combine ideas from multiple team members' implementations of the
wall follower to make a more robust controller.

Consider how to quantify how well a controller performs, and techniques to
improve controller performance.

### Some reasons it may not be working

- The number of lidar beams is different than in the simulator
- The field of view is different than in the simulator. 
- If you have a velodyne car, the lidar is not pointed forwards, it is rotated
by 60 degrees.

### Part 3: Safety Controller

Now that youâ€™ve got your wall follower working we want you to build a safety
controller. In future labs the racecar will be moving at high speeds so we need
you to build a system that protects it from crashes. 

Create a new package for your safety controller (place it
in ```~/racecar_ws/src```).
Your goal is to make a node in this pacakge that prevents the racecar from
crashing into obstacles.

We want you to be able to demonstrate that your safety controller is robust. You
should be able to attempt to crash the racecar in a variety of scenarios and
have the safety controller prevent the crashes. You should also be able to walk
in front of the racecar without it running into you. 

At the same time your racecar should not be "scared". You should still be able
to drive close to walls, turn around corners, go fast etc. without the racecar
freezing in its tracks. You will be required to run your safety controller in
all future labs so don't cripple yourself with something overprotective.

__Please be careful when you are testing__. Always have your joystick ready to
stop the racecar and start very slow. 

### Muxes

The racecar has a command mux with different levels of priority that you will
need in building your safety controller.

![Muxes](https://i.imgur.com/Y8oQCLe.png)

The navigation topic you have been publishing to is an alias for the highest
priority navigation topic in the mux ([defined here](https://github.mit.edu/2018-RSS/racecar_base_ros_install/blob/vm/racecar/racecar/launch/mux.launch)):

    /vesc/ackermann_cmd_mux/input/navigation -> /vesc/high_level/ackermann_cmd_mux/input/nav_0

For brevity we will refer to
```/vesc/high_level/ackermann_cmd_mux/input/nav_i``` as ```.../nav_i``` in this
handout (_this doesn't work on the actual racecar_).
Driving commands sent to ```.../nav_0``` override driving commands sent to
```.../nav_1```, ```.../nav_2```, etc.
Likewise driving commands sent to ```.../nav_1``` override driving commands sent
to ```.../nav_2```, ```.../nav_3```, etc.
You can use this structure to layer levels of control.

For example, a robot whose job it is to explore randomly and collect minerals as
it finds them could use 2 muxes.
The controller that explores randomly could publish to a lower priority topic
like ```.../nav_1```.
Whenever the vision system detects minerals, it could begin to publish commands
to a higher priority topic like ```.../nav_0```. ```.../nav_0``` would override
```.../nav_1``` until the minerals have been depleted and commands stopped being
published to```.../nav_0```.

The navigation command with the highest priority is then published to
```/vesc/high_level/ackermann_cmd_mux/output```. This topic is then piped to
```/vesc/low_level/ackermann_cmd_mux/input/navigation``` and fed into another
mux with the following priorities (from highest to lowest):

    /vesc/low_level/ackermann_cmd_mux/input/teleop
    /vesc/low_level/ackermann_cmd_mux/input/safety
    /vesc/low_level/ackermann_cmd_mux/input/navigation

```.../teleop``` is the topic that the joystick publishes to.
This will always have the highest priority.
```.../safety``` has the next highest priority. It will override anything
published to ```.../navigation```. This is where your safety controller will
publish.

So for your safety controller this means:

- Subscribe to ```/vesc/high_level/ackermann_cmd_mux/output``` to intercept the driving command that is being published.
- Subscribe to sensors like ```/scan```.
- Publish to ```/vesc/low_level/ackermann_cmd_mux/input/safety``` if the command being published to the navigation topic is in danger of crashing the racecar.
